Sentiment Analysis Project: Enhancing Customer Insights through Data-Driven Techniques

In this project, I developed and implemented a comprehensive sentiment analysis solution to help organizations better understand customer feedback and improve decision-making processes. Utilizing advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, I created a model capable of accurately classifying sentiments expressed in customer reviews, social media posts, and survey responses.
